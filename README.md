# A Basic MP Neuron
This is a basic model of a single McCulloch-Pitts Neuron for prediction.
A McCulloch-Pitts Neuron is based on taking the aggregate of all the inputs and then comparing the said aggregate (g) with the threshold (t).

So, if we have x1, x2, x3, ... , xn inputs:
g = x1 + x2 + x3 + ... + xn

And the result will be true iff g>=t
